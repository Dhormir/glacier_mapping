        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Layers: To toggle between landsat channels (5-4-2),
                high-resolution ESRI imagery, and overall model predictions, use the
                tile icon on the top right of the map display.
            </li>
            <li> Predictions: Press the <i>Shift</i> key to create a box within
                which to make predictions. When you click, the model will run,
                and the results will appear as a geojson layer. Press the
                <i>ESC</i> key to remove the box and exit prediction mode. If
                the box is not appearing, try dragging the map first.
            </li>
            <li> Editing: To edit predicted polygons, click the <i>Edit
                layers</i> button (vertex next to a mouse icon). Click and drag a
                purple square to change its position. Click and drag a green
                square to indroduce a new vertex at that position. Click both
                mouse buttons on a vertex to remove it. To stop editing, click
                the edit button again.

            <li> Adding / deleting polygons: To create a new polygon, trace out
                its shape after pressing the <i>New Polygon</i> button (triangle at
                the top left). To delete a layer, select the eraser icon on the left
                and click the layer to remove.
            </li>
